# Reg Keys Api Unhooker
Inspired by https://www.insecurity.be/blog/2018/01/21/retrieving-ntlm-hashes-and-what-changed-technical-writeup/, the API Unhooker technique from https://github.com/RedLectroid/APIunhooker, along with some help from ChatGPT, I decided to bring those two together and write some programs and a script that will dump the required values from the SYSTEM and SAM keys in order to obtain a user's NTHash. The `C++` programs were compiled in **visual studio** and the *python script* only requires `pip install pycryptodome`.
